    "## Creating Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** or **string literals** are a sequence or characters. They are usually used to represent human language, file names, web addresses, etc. Things that are non-numeric sequences of characters are usually strings, but it is possible for a sequence of numeric characters to be a string as well. Stings in Python are created with either single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`\" \"`). You will definitely see them both ways. Some people prefer to use single quotes as it is one less key stroke. Here are some examples of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'We are leaning Python'`\n",
    "- `\"Python is the 3rd most popular programming language.\"`\n",
    "- `'a'`\n",
    "- `'main.py'`\n",
    "- `\"https://www.google.com/\"`\n",
    "- `'3.141592653589793238462643383279'`\n",
    "- `\" \"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the examples above are a sequence of characters between either `' '` or `\" \"`. The first two examples are sentences. The third is a single character. The fourth example is a file name. The fifth is the URL to Google. And even though the sixth example may appear to be numeric, it is also a string. The final string example is just a space. Even though this may not seem like a character, Python recognizes it as a character. This is an example of what is known as **whitespace**. Whitespace will be covered more in the subsequent lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, it does not matter if `' '` is used or `\" \"` are used. Python will interpret them the same way. In fact it does not affect the string between the two types of quotes mention. We can test two strings using the **equality operator** (`==`) to determine if the they are the same or equal. Type the following in the code cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Python' == \"Python\"\n",
    "```"

    "\n",
    "When you create an object such as a string in Python, it is stored somewhere on the memory. **Variables** give you a way to access the string so it can be used again. You can create variables that point to strings using the assignment operator `=`. Variables are created as follows:\n",
